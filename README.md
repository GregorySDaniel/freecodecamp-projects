# FreeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains my projects from FreeCodeCamp certifications. These projects were implemented as part of my journey to improve my web development and programming skills.

Each folder corresponds to a specific certification, and the project names match the ones provided by FreeCodeCamp.

---

New projects will be added as I progress through the certifications.
